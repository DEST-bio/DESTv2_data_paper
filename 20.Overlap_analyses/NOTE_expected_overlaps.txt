let’s say you have two sets of SNPs, A and B.
In each set, there is a subset that are “hits”/“significant”: a & b.
After finding the intersection of A and B, you now have a list C and the subset of significant hits are a' and b'
The fraction of hits is:
a'/C = p
b'/C = q
The expected overlap of the two is p*q*C
