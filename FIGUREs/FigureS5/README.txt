This folder contains Rnotebooks and data to reproduce the figures and final analyses for the pop-gen estimators comparison.

The main notebook is the file 'popgen_stats_comparisons.Rmd', this will read .RData objects from the 'rdata/' folder and re-produce the figures in the manuscript.

The other notebooks are for completeness to show how the raw output from npstat and EggLib was processed to produce the summaries.

N.B. the raw output from EggLib and npstat are not included in this folder.
